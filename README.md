# SQL-application-for-house-data-
In this project I created a GUI application in python based on SQL commands. The project has two parts:
1st is the prefined query in which few of the quieries are already defined in the program and based on those commands the output is displayed. 
2nd is the user defined query in which the third party user using this gui can directly write the SQL commandbased on their interest and obtain results.
This GUI application is based on house prices dataset and there is even option of selecting your own dataset since it is given as a input command.
